# SPOTIFY ETL DATA PIPELINE
The goal of every data project is to bring value to the business thatâ€™s why we collect different type of data so that we derive different insights from that.

we have a client who is passionate about music industry and want to understand this music industry by collecting different data so that he can find some pattern and make music base on that so on Spotify we have multiple playlist available and for starter our client want to start with the top global songs. every single week he want to collect top global song available on the bill board of Spotify so that he can understand what type of song people like and what type of song is in trending or what kind of album are trending and who is the artist making this song so all of these information we will be extracting from Spotify API.
so Spotify is music streaming app so that you can play the song you like and whatever song you can find here so that play list of top global song updates weekly so what our client wants to build a large dataset throughout the year so he want to start collecting that data on weekly basis so that after one year or two year he can find different insights based on all of these data so for that he want to build ETL pipeline or data pipeline
